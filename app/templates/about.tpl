            <h2>Why do you choose 'I Love Neutrinos'?</h2>
            <h3>Classroom</h3>
            <p>
The classroom has a limit number of students to maintain the quality of the educative experience. We think that ILN is a educative program, not a business oriented to courses. We try to find a balance between contents, problems and number of students.
            </p>
            <h3>Teachers</h3>
            <p>
We only hire experts. Real experts are rare to find and maintain in teams. We believe in the finnish model. The best profesionals should teach next generations with the experience adquired in the industry.
            </p>
            <h3>Contents</h3>
            <p>
Students only adquire real knowledge. Teachers have the mission to filter and develop right contents for the classes. In the course, students use the knowledge to participate in global contents and tests the learning process. In the development of the projects, students learn key values as: Team building, Cooperation, Pressure points, Failure and achievement feelings.
            </p>
            <h3>Personalized monitoring</h3>
            <p>
Every student is different and their motivations. Teachers tries to mentor and guide to improve the educative process.
            </p>
            <h3>Spirit</h3>
            <p>
We think in the Excellence concept and we transmit the value in the classrooms.
The list of issues always to be empty. Students have to find new challenges and not repeat the same exercises.
